PYCRAFT CHANGELOG
- last update: 10 Dec, 2021

This changelog is an incomplete history of minor versions.
Smaller patches are directly applied to minor versions. Therefore, there may be differences between two instances of version 1.1.
The minor versioning is only updated when there's a critical update for security, older versions than the latest should probably not be used.
